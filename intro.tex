\section*{Introduction}

Throughout this paper we assume known the content of the course \emph{Algebraic
Curves} given by Dimitri Wyss.
Whenever we talk about algebraic varieties defined over a field $K$, we
will assume $K$ is algebraically closed, unless stated otherwise.
Furthermore, throughout this paper, we will assume that
$\chr(K) \not\in \{2, 3\}$
